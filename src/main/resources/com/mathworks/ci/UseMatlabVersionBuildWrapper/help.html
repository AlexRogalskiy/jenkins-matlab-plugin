        Use this list to specify the MATLAB version for the build. The plugin prepends your specified MATLAB to the PATH environment variable and uses it to perform the build. <br>
        The list contains the names of all MATLAB versions that have been registered as a tool in <u>Jenkins Global Tool Configuration</u>. Select one of the tools, or select <b>Custom…</b> if you want to specify a different version. When you select <b>Custom…</b>, you must enter the full path to the desired MATLAB root folder in the <b>MATLAB root</b> box.

        <b>Note:</b> For a Multi-configuration project that has 'MATLAB' axis added, 'Use MATLAB Version' value takes precedence over the values specified by the 'MATLAB' axis.
