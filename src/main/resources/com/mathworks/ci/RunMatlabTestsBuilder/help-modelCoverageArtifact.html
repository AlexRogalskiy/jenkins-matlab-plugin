Generate a model coverage report in Cobertura XML format. By default, MATLAB names the artifact <b>coberturamodelcoverage.xml</b> and stores it in the <b>matlabTestArtifacts</b> folder of the project workspace. 
This report includes coverage results for Simulink&#174; models that are tested using Simulink Test&#8482;.
To override the default artifact name and location, specify a path relative to the project folder in the <b>File path</b> box. If the text box is empty, MATLAB does not generate an artifact.
<br>
<br><b>Note:</b> This feature requires a <b>Simulink Coverage&#8482;</b> license and is supported only in MATLAB R2018b or a newer release.<br>
